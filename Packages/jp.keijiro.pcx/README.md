**Pcx** is a custom importer and renderer that allows for handling point cloud data
in Unity.

System Requirements
-------------------

- Unity 2019.4

Supported Formats
-----------------

Currently Pcx only supports PLY binary little-endian format.

How To Install
--------------

The Pcx package uses the [scoped registry] feature to import dependent
packages. Please add the following sections to the package manifest file
(`Packages/manifest.json`).

To the `scopedRegistries` section:

```
{
  "name": "Keijiro",
  "url": "https://registry.npmjs.com",
  "scopes": [ "jp.keijiro" ]
}
```

To the `dependencies` section:

```
"jp.keijiro.pcx": "1.0.1"
```

After changes, the manifest file should look like below:

```
{
  "scopedRegistries": [
    {
      "name": "Keijiro",
      "url": "https://registry.npmjs.com",
      "scopes": [ "jp.keijiro" ]
    }
  ],
  "dependencies": {
    "jp.keijiro.pcx": "1.0.1",
    ...
```

Container Types
---------------

There are three types of container for point clouds.

### Mesh

Points are to be contained in a `Mesh` object. They can be rendered with the
standard `MeshRenderer` component. It's recommended to use the custom shaders
included in Pcx (`Point Cloud/Point` and `Point Cloud/Disk`).

### ComputeBuffer

Points are to be contained in a `PointCloudData` object, which uses
`ComputeBuffer` to store point data. It can be rendered with using the
`PointCloudRenderer` component.

### Texture

Points are baked into `Texture2D` objects that can be used as attribute maps
in [Visual Effect Graph].

Rendering Methods
-----------------

There are two types of rendering methods in Pcx.

### Point (point primitives)

Points are rendered as point primitives when using the `Point Cloud/Point`
shader.

The size of points can be adjusted by changing the material properties.

These size properties are only supported on some platforms; It may work with
OpenGLCore and Metal, but never work with D3D11/12.

This method is also used when the point size is set to zero in
`PointCloudRenderer`.

### Disk (geometry shader)

Points are rendered as small disks when using the `Point Cloud/Disk` shader or
`PointCloudRenderer`.

This method requires geometry shader support.
